# React Advance Patterns

React project from the [Ultimate React Course](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/ultimate-react-course) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Knowledge applied:

- **Renders Props Patter**: a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.
- **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**: an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. Concretely, a higher-order component _is a function that takes a component and returns a new component_.
- **Compound Component Patter**: a design pattern in React to have a component that renders one or more child components that work together to form a cohesive user interface.
